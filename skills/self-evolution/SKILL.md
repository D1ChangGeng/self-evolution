description: "Initialize and maintain a project self-evolution knowledge base. Creates .agents/knowledge/ with lifecycle management: capture, organize, verify, promote, compress, and retire project knowledge. Installs tool lifecycle hooks, including OpenCode native plugin registration with an absolute file:/// URL so Linux does not treat the project path as a URL host. Use this skill whenever the user asks to initialize project knowledge, set up AGENTS.md, create a knowledge base, evolve project documentation, check knowledge health, install knowledge hooks, or crystallize workflows into skills. Also use when users say 'set up project memory', 'initialize project context', 'create project brain', or any variation of wanting persistent, evolving project knowledge for AI-assisted development."

# Project Self-Evolution Knowledge System

This skill creates and governs a living knowledge base that evolves with a software project. It addresses three fundamental gaps: the reality gap (actual state vs documented), the access gap (documented vs discoverable), and the trust gap (discovered vs trustworthy).

Read `references/philosophy.md` if you need to understand WHY the system works this way. This file tells you WHAT to do and WHEN.

## Mode Detection

Determine the operating mode from context:

| User says | Mode |
|-----------|------|
| "initialize", "init", "set up knowledge base" | **Initialize** (auto-detects empty vs existing) |
| "deep onboard", "comprehensive init", "audit and restructure" | **Deep Brownfield Onboarding** (Mode 2B) |
| "evolve", "update knowledge", "compress inbox", "promote" | **Evolve** |
| "check health", "KB health", "knowledge base status" | **Health Check** |
| "crystallize", "turn this into a workflow", "formalize this process" | **Crystallize** |
| "improve the skill", "skill maintenance", "fix the skill" | **Skill Maintenance** |
| (completing a non-trivial task, no explicit request) | **Capture** (ambient) |

For Initialize mode, the skill automatically detects project state and follows the appropriate path:

- **Empty project**: No `src/`, `lib/`, `app/` directories AND no language manifest (package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, pyproject.toml, pom.xml, etc.) → Create skeleton only
- **Existing project**: Has source directories OR language manifests → Deep scan, generate initial knowledge

There is no separate "init-deep" trigger — deep initialization is the natural behavior when the skill encounters an existing project.

## Filesystem Contract

Every initialization creates this exact structure. No exceptions.

## Initialization Quality Contract

These rules apply to ALL initialization modes (1, 2, 2B). They enforce deep, evidence-based work and prevent shallow output. Bias toward thoroughness during initialization — this is a one-time investment that shapes every future session.

**Mode 1 exception**: Because empty projects have no source code to read, domain-file minimum content thresholds and the semantic project-specificity self-review do not apply until project files exist. Mode 1 generates only the scaffold and governance structure — no domain knowledge. The Quality Contract still applies to scaffold output: AGENTS.md must have no unresolved placeholders, manifest must be valid, and hooks must be executable.

### Read-Before-Write Rule

Before writing any knowledge file, you MUST have read the source files you will cite. If you cannot cite a claim to a specific file and line, the claim is either an Open Question or must not be written as a Verified Fact. No exceptions.

Prepare an internal evidence ledger before generating each domain file:
- Domain name and scope
- Files read (list paths)
- Claims to include (with source citations)
- Open questions (things you couldn't verify)

### Minimum Substantive Content Rule

| File type | Minimum requirement |
|---|---|
| Domain file | Substantive content in at least 3 sections + at least 3 source citations + at least 5 project-specific facts |
| AGENTS.md invariant | Must cite a specific file, symbol, route, or config key |
| AGENTS.md anti-pattern | Must describe a concrete failure mode (not a vague principle) |
| AGENTS.md "Where to Look" row | Must point to an existing file or directory |
| AGENTS.md commands | Must come from package manifests, Makefiles, CI configs, or direct project evidence |
| Inbox observation | Must include: what was observed, why it matters, source citation |

### Placeholder Rejection Rule

No section may contain only `-`, `TODO`, `TBD`, `placeholder`, `to be filled`, or generic boilerplate. If a section genuinely has no content, write a cited explanation of why (e.g., "No test patterns found — project has no test directory [source: directory scan]").

### Concurrent Exploration Rule

For existing projects, fire background exploration agents BEFORE reading individual files. Scale agent count to project size:

| Factor | Threshold | Additional agents |
|---|---|---|
| Total files | >100 | +1 per 100 files |
| Total lines | >10k | +1 per 10k lines |
| Directory depth | ≥4 | +2 for deep exploration |
| Large files (>500 lines) | >10 | +1 for complexity hotspots |
| Multiple languages | >1 | +1 per language |

For small projects (<100 files), the base 6 exploration agents are sufficient.

### Verification Rule

Before reporting initialization complete:
1. **Structural check**: Every generated file has required sections populated, citations present, no placeholders
2. **Semantic self-review**: For each generated file, answer: "Could this content have been written without reading this project?" If yes, the file needs more project-specific detail.
3. **Path validation**: Every file path in "Where to Look" and source citations points to an existing file
4. **Completeness check**: All items in the Completion Criteria for the active mode are satisfied

### Anti-Shallow-Work Patterns

These patterns indicate the agent is not doing deep work. If caught, stop and redo:

- Generating domain files with section headers but no substantive bullets
- Writing invariants without source citations
- Copying README content verbatim instead of analyzing code
- Generating generic best-practice advice instead of project-specific observations
- Skipping the evidence ledger and writing claims from memory
- Declaring initialization complete without running verification checks

---

**Path convention**: All `references/...` paths in this skill (scripts, templates, hooks, specs) are relative to the installed skill directory, NOT the project root. Resolve them from wherever your tool installed this skill (e.g., `~/.agents/skills/self-evolution/references/...` or the equivalent on your platform).

### Script Adaptation Protocol

The bundled scripts (`scan-project.sh`, `init-scaffold.sh`, `audit-agents.sh`) cover common project structures but cannot anticipate every project type. They are starting points, not ceilings.

**After running any script, check its output for gaps:**

1. **Read the `HEURISTIC GAPS` section** at the end of scan output. It lists what the scanner cannot detect.
2. **Supplement with manual discovery**: read manifests, imports, configs, and directory structures that the script missed. Add `[DETECTED]` findings to domain files.
3. **Adapt generated content**: if the script produced AGENTS.md or domain files with overly generic sections, replace them with project-specific content based on what you read.
4. **Feed improvements back**: if a project type would benefit from a scanner check that doesn't exist, write an inbox entry tagged `[SKILL-IDEA:self-evolution]` describing the detection rule (e.g., "scan-project.sh should detect Bazel via BUILD files").

**When to adapt vs when to report:**

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Script missed a technology that manifests/imports reveal | Add to domain files now, feed back via `[SKILL-IDEA]` |
| Script output section is wrong for this project type | Correct in generated files now, feed back via `[SKILL-FIX]` |
| Project uses a build system the script doesn't recognize | Read build files manually, document in `domains/development.md` |
| Monorepo / polyglot / embedded / unconventional structure | Expand directory scan beyond script output, document findings |
| Script works but output is shallow for a large project | Increase read budget, run deeper exploration agents |

This protocol ensures every project gets adequate coverage while building a feedback loop that improves the scripts over time.

## Mode 1: Initialize — Empty Project

Create the knowledge base skeleton. The scaffold script (`init-scaffold.sh`) generates AGENTS.md from its embedded content — the template file `references/templates/root-agents-empty.md` serves as documentation of the intended structure but the script output is authoritative. Read the template to understand the target structure, then run the script.

### Steps

0. **Pre-Validation (Skill Self-Check)**:
   Read `references/EVOLUTION-SPEC.md`. If this file does not exist yet (first use after installation), copy it from the skill's `EVOLUTION-SPEC.md` template and add empty `Known Improvement Backlog` and `Review Log` sections. For each of the 9 design dimensions, evaluate:
   - "Based on my current knowledge, does this choice still represent best practice?"
   - "Does this specific project have needs that challenge this choice?"
   If all dimensions pass, proceed. If any dimension's change trigger fires, read the linked deep reference, propose improvement to user, and update the spec before continuing. If a dimension's `last_reviewed` exceeds 60 days, force a deep review.

1. Detect project name from directory name or git remote
2. Run the scaffold script:
   ```sh
   sh "references/scripts/init-scaffold.sh" \
     --project-name "$PROJECT_NAME" \
     --mode empty \
     --project-root "$PROJECT_ROOT"
   ```
   This creates all directories, README.md, manifest.json, knowledge-protocol.md, and AGENTS.md with defaults filled.
3. Verify the script output: confirm AGENTS.md exists, all directories created, manifest.json is valid
4. Generate scope-triggered rules (see Scope-Triggered Rules Generation section)
5. **Run Hook Integration Decision Point** (see `## Hook Integration Decision Point` section later in this file). Present the 5-option prompt (opencode / claude-code / cursor / augment-code / custom). Run installer for the chosen tool OR record the declination / deferral in `manifest.json` `hooks.integration`. Do NOT silently skip this step. Do NOT claim "hooks installed" when only the shell scripts are present.
6. Report completion: list created files, state the hook integration outcome explicitly ("hooks active: opencode" / "hooks deferred" / "hooks declined"), and explain what to do next.

### Mode 1 Quality Gate
- All required files exist (AGENTS.md, README.md, manifest.json, knowledge-protocol.md, hook scripts)
- AGENTS.md contains no unresolved `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` variables
- manifest.json is valid JSON with correct project name
- Hook scripts are executable

### Completion Criteria
- AGENTS.md exists at project root with CODING DISCIPLINE, POST-TASK CHECKLIST and SELF-EVOLUTION RULES
- .agents/knowledge/ exists with README.md, manifest.json, and 7 subdirectories
- .agents/rules/ exists with at least knowledge-protocol.md
- .agents/hooks/ contains the 3 shell scripts (session-end.sh, stop.sh, compact-recovery.sh) — scripts on disk
- **Hook integration decision recorded**: `manifest.json` `hooks.integration` is one of `opencode | claude-code | cursor | augment-code | custom | declined | deferred`. If a tool was selected, the corresponding adapter file (`.opencode/opencode.json` / `.claude/settings.json` / `.cursor/hooks.json` / `.augment/settings.json`) is present and references the hook scripts. "Scripts on disk" alone does NOT satisfy this criterion.
- No knowledge content generated (the project is empty — knowledge accumulates through use)
- No project scan runs (no code to scan)
- No skill discovery runs (no detected technologies); `manifest.json` `skills.pending_review` remains empty

---

## Mode 2: Initialize — Existing Project

Scan the project, generate initial knowledge, and create the structure. This mode adapts the scanning methodology from `/init-deep` (see `references/init-deep-reference.md`) with our knowledge lifecycle additions.

### Step 0: Pre-Validation (Skill Self-Check)

Before scanning, evaluate the skill's own design:

1. Read `references/EVOLUTION-SPEC.md` (if it does not exist, copy from the skill's `EVOLUTION-SPEC.md` template and add empty Backlog + Review Log sections)
2. For each of the 9 design dimensions, evaluate:
   - "Based on my current knowledge, does this choice still represent best practice?"
   - "Does this specific project have needs that challenge this choice?"
3. If ALL dimensions pass → proceed to Pre-Scan
4. If ANY dimension's change trigger fires:
   a. Read the linked deep reference file
   b. Describe the proposed improvement and rationale
   c. Wait for user confirmation
   d. Update the relevant template/script/spec
   e. Log the change in EVOLUTION-SPEC.md Review Log
   f. Then proceed to Pre-Scan
5. If a dimension's `last_reviewed` exceeds 60 days, force a deep review even if no trigger explicitly fires

### Pre-Scan: Check for Existing Knowledge Artifacts

Before scanning from scratch, check if the project already has knowledge artifacts:

1. **Existing AGENTS.md files** at any directory level — these may have been generated by `/init-deep` or written manually. Read them as high-quality input; import relevant content into `.agents/knowledge/domains/` with `confidence: observed`.
2. **Existing `.agents/` or `.claude/` directories** — preserve them, integrate with our structure.
3. **Existing CLAUDE.md** — read and import content similarly.

If rich existing artifacts are found, the scanning passes below can be lighter — focus on gaps rather than full coverage.

### Pass 1: Structural Inventory (Concurrent)

Fire background explore agents immediately while main session does structural analysis. Reference `references/init-deep-reference.md` for the dynamic agent spawning methodology.

**Background agents (fire simultaneously, collect later):**
- Project structure explorer — report non-standard organization
- Entry points finder — report main files and routing
- Conventions detector — find config files (.eslintrc, pyproject.toml, .editorconfig)
- Anti-patterns finder — find DO NOT/NEVER/ALWAYS/DEPRECATED comments
- Build/CI analyzer — find .github/workflows, Makefile, Dockerfile
- Test patterns analyzer — find test configs and conventions

**Main session concurrent analysis:**
1. **Directory structure**: List all directories (exclude node_modules, .git, venv, dist, build)
2. **Language detection**: Identify from manifests (package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, pom.xml, build.gradle, Makefile, CMakeLists.txt)
3. **File counts per directory**: Identify complexity hotspots
4. **Existing documentation**: Locate README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/, existing AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, .cursor/rules/
5. **Config examples**: Locate config.example.*, .env.example, etc.

**Scale-adaptive agent spawning**: For large projects (>100 files), spawn additional agents per the thresholds in `references/init-deep-reference.md`.

### Pass 2: Targeted High-Signal Reads

After collecting Pass 1 results, read specific files. Prioritize by init-deep's complexity scoring (see reference): directories with higher file count, code ratio, module boundaries, and export counts get more attention.

1. **Main entry points**: main.*, app.*, index.*, src/main.*, src/lib.*
2. **Routing/API definitions**: routes.*, router.*, api.*, server.*
3. **Package manifests**: Read dependency sections for tech stack details
4. **Existing docs**: Read README.md fully, skim other docs
5. **Intent vs Reality check**: Compare what README/docs claim about the project against what the code actually does. Record divergences explicitly in `inbox/` — these are the highest-value findings from a scan (e.g., "README says X protocol, code actually uses Y").
6. **Config files**: Read config examples for configurable parameters
7. **CI configs**: Read for build/test/deploy commands
8. **Key test files**: 1-2 test files to understand testing patterns

For projects >100 files: increase read budget proportionally. The 15-20 file limit is a baseline, not a cap.

### Generate Output

Generate files in this order — domain files first, then AGENTS.md (because AGENTS.md placeholders like `{{TOPIC_ENTRIES}}`, `{{CORE_INVARIANTS}}`, `{{CRITICAL_ANTI_PATTERNS}}` depend on domain file content).

### Scaffold Setup

Before generating project-specific content, create the base scaffold:

```sh
sh "references/scripts/init-scaffold.sh" \
  --project-name "$PROJECT_NAME" \
  --mode existing \
  --project-root "$PROJECT_ROOT"
```

This creates all directories, README.md, initial manifest.json, and knowledge-protocol.md. The remaining steps below generate only project-specific content.

Then run the project scanner to collect structural metadata:

```sh
sh "references/scripts/scan-project.sh" \
  --project-root "$PROJECT_ROOT" \
  --output "$PROJECT_ROOT/.agents/knowledge/reference/.project-scan.txt"
```

This produces a deterministic report of file counts, language detection, manifest presence, CI/CD config, testing infrastructure, and **detected technologies** — saving ~500 tokens of LLM tool-use overhead during Pass 1.

Use the `DETECTED TECHNOLOGIES` section of the scan output as input for `find-skills` (see Skill Ecosystem in AGENTS.md) to discover relevant best-practice skills for the project. When candidates are found, write them to `manifest.json` `skills.pending_review` immediately — do not interrupt the user for confirmation during init. At the end of initialization, present the pending list for user review. Installed skills go to `skills.installed`.

1. Generate **domain files** under `.agents/knowledge/domains/`. Use template `references/templates/topic-template.md`:

   **Every domain file MUST have a populated `scope:` field** listing the directories it covers (e.g., `scope: ["src/payments/", "src/middleware/pay*"]`). This is required for scope-triggered rules generation.

   **Always generate:**
   - `domains/tech-stack.md` — languages, frameworks, key dependencies

   **Generate if evidence found:**
   - `domains/architecture.md` — module layout, entry points, dependency flow
   - `domains/development.md` — build, test, run, deploy commands
   - `domains/api.md` — endpoints and API patterns (if routing files found)
   - Additional domain files based on project's primary concerns

   File count scales with project complexity: 3-5 for small projects, up to 8-10 for large monorepos.

   **Cross-cutting knowledge**: Some knowledge doesn't fit neatly into one domain (e.g., tooling conventions that span all modules, workspace-level build rules, debugging methodologies). Place these in the MOST SPECIFIC domain that applies. If genuinely project-wide, place in the domain closest to where the knowledge is most often needed. Never drop knowledge because it doesn't fit a clean category — an imperfect placement is better than loss.

   **Domain file structure** (each domain file follows the template but adapts content to the actual project):

   ```
   frontmatter: type, confidence, scope (directories this domain covers), sources (files read), dates
   # {Domain Name}
   ## Core Invariants    — rules that must not be broken (used by scope-triggered rules)
   ## Conventions        — standard practices for this area
   ## Common Mistakes    — anti-patterns with real-world evidence (used by scope-triggered rules)
   ## Verified Facts     — claims confirmed by code/tests
   ## Working Understanding — reasonable beliefs not yet fully confirmed
   ## Open Questions     — unknowns and things needing verification
   ## Related            — cross-references to other knowledge files
   ## Correction History — record of corrected claims (what was wrong, what replaced it, why)
   ```

   Adapt sections to the project: a domain about deployment might have heavy Conventions and few Verified Facts; a domain about a core algorithm might have many Verified Facts and few Conventions. If a section genuinely has no content, write a brief cited explanation (e.g., "No common mistakes identified — project is newly scanned [source: init scan]") rather than leaving it empty.

   **Concrete example** (illustrative — your domains will differ by project):

   ```markdown
   ---
   type: domain
   confidence: observed
   scope: ["src/payments/", "src/middleware/pay*"]
   sources: ["src/payments/processor.py", "src/payments/gateway.py", "README.md"]
   last_verified: 2026-04-25
   created: 2026-04-25
   ---
   <!-- Generated by init. Verify against current code before relying on these claims. -->

   # Payments

   ## Core Invariants
   - All monetary amounts stored as integers (cents) to avoid floating-point drift
   - Refund requests validate against original transaction before processing

   ## Common Mistakes
   - Never compare monetary amounts using floating-point equality

   ## Verified Facts
   - Gateway timeout is 30s [source: src/payments/config.py:42]

   ## Open Questions
   - What happens when a refund is issued after the settlement window closes?
   ```

2. Generate **reference files** under `.agents/knowledge/reference/`. Use template `references/templates/reference-template.md`:
   - `reference/code-map.md` — full directory structure + comprehensive "Where to Look" routing table
   - Additional reference files for stable documentation (architecture diagrams, API surface, etc.)

3. **Now** create `AGENTS.md` from template `references/templates/root-agents-existing.md`:
   - Fill `{{TOPIC_ENTRIES}}` from the domain files generated in step 1
   - Fill `{{CORE_INVARIANTS}}` by extracting the top invariants from domain files' Core Invariants sections
   - Fill `{{CRITICAL_ANTI_PATTERNS}}` by extracting the top anti-patterns from domain files' Common Mistakes sections
   - Fill all other `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` variables (see Template Variables section)
   - Content is in **bootstrap state** — see AGENTS.md Authority Model below

4. Generate `inbox/{YYYY-MM}.md` with observations that don't fit domains:
   - Unusual patterns noticed during scan
   - Questions raised by code structure
   - Inconsistencies between docs and code

5. **Update** `manifest.json` with populated inventory (since the scaffold already created the base file; see Manifest Inventory Entry Schema below)
6. Generate scope-triggered rules (see Scope-Triggered Rules Generation section)
7. **Run Hook Integration Decision Point** (see `## Hook Integration Decision Point` section later in this file). Present the 5-option prompt (opencode / claude-code / cursor / augment-code / custom). Run installer for the chosen tool OR record the declination / deferral in `manifest.json` `hooks.integration`. Do NOT silently skip. Do NOT claim "hooks installed" when only shell scripts are present.

### Manifest Inventory Entry Schema

Each entry in the `inventory` array of `manifest.json` must follow this structure:

```json
{
  "path": "domains/payments.md",
  "type": "domain",
  "scope": ["src/payments/", "src/middleware/pay*"],
  "confidence": "observed",
  "last_verified": "2026-04-25"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `path` | string | Relative path from `.agents/knowledge/` |
| `type` | string | One of: `domain`, `reference`, `decision`, `pattern`, `crystallized`, `inbox` |
| `scope` | string[] | Directories/files this knowledge covers |
| `confidence` | string | One of: `observed`, `verified`, `canonical` |
| `last_verified` | string | ISO date of last verification |

### Skill Candidate Schema

Each entry in the `skills.pending_review` array of `manifest.json` must follow this structure:

```json
{
  "name": "vue-best-practices",
  "reason": "Detected Vue in package.json dependencies",
  "source": "init scan",
  "added": "2026-04-25"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Skill name as used by `find-skills` or `npx skills add` |
| `reason` | string | Why this skill was suggested (detected technology, user request, etc.) |
| `source` | string | How it was discovered: `init scan`, `find-skills`, `user request`, `mode 7 radar` |
| `added` | string | ISO date when the candidate was added |

Confirmed installs move to `skills.installed` with the same fields plus `installed: "{date}"`.

### Hook Integration Schema

`manifest.json` MUST contain a top-level `hooks` object once the Hook Integration Decision Point has run. Schema:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "integration": "opencode",
    "decided_at": "2026-05-07T01:00:00Z",
    "adapter_path": ".opencode/opencode.json",
    "note": "Native plugin via opencode-plugin.mjs; preserves global providers and MCP."
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `integration` | string | One of: `opencode`, `claude-code`, `cursor`, `augment-code`, `custom`, `declined`, `deferred` |
| `decided_at` | string | ISO datetime when the decision was recorded |
| `adapter_path` | string \| null | Relative path to the adapter file. Required for the four named tools. `null` for `custom` / `declined` / `deferred`. |
| `note` | string | Free-form rationale or operational note. For `custom`, document the manual integration path. For `declined`, document why. |

**State transitions**:

- `deferred` → any other state on the next init / evolve / health-check session that re-asks the decision
- `opencode | claude-code | cursor | augment-code` → `declined` if the user later removes the adapter (record this transition in evolve mode)
- `custom` → a named tool if the user later switches to a bundled integration

The decision point is rerun ONLY when `integration` is missing OR set to `deferred`. Other states are stable and should not re-prompt.

### AGENTS.md Authority Model

AGENTS.md serves two roles that appear to conflict:

1. **Bootstrap role (init-deep)**: Contains observed-confidence content generated from scanning. This is necessary — an AGENTS.md with only placeholders is useless.
2. **Canonical role (steady state)**: Contains only stable, verified, high-value knowledge.

The resolution: **AGENTS.md has a bootstrap phase.**

- During init-deep, generated content enters AGENTS.md marked with `<!-- bootstrap: verify and promote to canonical -->`. This is acceptable because a useful-but-observed AGENTS.md is better than an empty one.
- Over time, as knowledge is verified through use, bootstrap markers are removed.
- The SELF-EVOLUTION RULES section and POST-TASK CHECKLIST are canonical from day one (they're from the template, not from scanning).
- New conventions added after bootstrap MUST be canonical (verified through patterns/).

### Init Confidence Rules

- **Facts from file presence/syntax/config**: `confidence: observed`
- **Facts from manifests** (deps, features): `confidence: observed` (use `verified` only if cross-checked with actual import/usage)
- **Interpretive claims** (architecture rationale, design patterns): `confidence: observed`, placed in "Working Understanding" section
- **Nothing from init scan may be `canonical`** (except pre-filled template sections)
- Every generated file must list `sources:` with actual files that were read
- Every domain file must have an "Open Questions" section
- Add this note to every generated domain file: `<!-- Generated by init. Verify against current code before relying on these claims. -->`
- **Mark unknowns explicitly**: Use `[TODO]` for items resolvable by reading code, `[ASK USER]` for items requiring human input. This distinction lets evolve mode triage automatically.

### Handling Existing AGENTS.md

If the project already has an AGENTS.md:
1. Read it fully
2. Do NOT overwrite it
3. Create `.agents/knowledge/` structure and generate domain files
4. **Augment** the existing AGENTS.md:
   - If it lacks a CODING DISCIPLINE section: append one (from template)
   - If it lacks a POST-TASK CHECKLIST: append one (from template)
   - If it lacks SELF-EVOLUTION RULES: append them (from template)
   - If it lacks a SESSION START section: append one (from template)
   - Insert sections at the end of the file, before any existing closing comments
5. Import relevant content from existing AGENTS.md into domain files as `confidence: observed`
6. **Post-decomposition verification**: If an existing AGENTS.md was decomposed into domain files, verify that every substantive bullet from the original is present in at least one knowledge file. Scan the original line by line — any bullet not accounted for goes into `inbox/` as a captured observation rather than being silently dropped.
7. Note in the report which sections were imported vs augmented, and any items placed in inbox as uncategorized

### Mode 2 Quality Gate (in addition to Initialization Quality Contract)
- Each domain file has substantive content in at least 3 sections
- Each domain file includes at least 3 source citations (`[source: file:line]`)
- Each domain file includes at least 5 project-specific facts (not generic advice)
- AGENTS.md invariants cite specific files; anti-patterns describe concrete failure modes
- "Where to Look" entries point to existing files/directories

### Completion Criteria
- AGENTS.md exists (created or augmented) with CODING DISCIPLINE, POST-TASK CHECKLIST and SELF-EVOLUTION RULES
- .agents/knowledge/ exists with README.md, manifest.json, and all 7 subdirectories (inbox, domains, reference, decisions, patterns, crystallized, archive)
- All generated content has confidence: observed (except template governance sections)
- All generated files have sources listing actual files read
- inbox/ has initial observations from scan
- .agents/rules/ exists with scope-triggered rules matching generated domains
- .agents/hooks/ contains the 3 shell scripts (session-end.sh, stop.sh, compact-recovery.sh) — scripts on disk
- **Hook integration decision recorded**: `manifest.json` `hooks.integration` is one of `opencode | claude-code | cursor | augment-code | custom | declined | deferred`. If a tool was selected, the corresponding adapter file is present and references the hook scripts. "Scripts on disk" alone does NOT satisfy this criterion.

## Mode 2B: Deep Brownfield Onboarding

For existing projects with accumulated code, documentation, and possibly noisy AGENTS.md files. Triggered by "deep onboard", "comprehensive init", or "audit and restructure". Also offered when Mode 2 detects an existing AGENTS.md with >200 lines.

This mode runs AFTER standard Mode 2 (or independently on already-initialized projects). It produces high-quality knowledge equivalent to a senior engineer's first-week understanding.

### Resumable Phase Architecture

Each phase writes its output before the next begins. The user can interrupt and resume at any phase. Progress is tracked in `.agents/knowledge/reference/onboarding-state.json`:

```json
{
  "started": "2026-04-27T10:00:00Z",
  "phases": {
    "audit": "completed",
    "inventory": "completed",
    "extract": "in_progress",
    "migrate": "pending",
    "restructure": "pending",
    "discover": "pending"
  }
}
```

### Phase 1: Audit Existing AGENTS.md

Run the audit script:

```sh
sh "references/scripts/audit-agents.sh" --file "$PROJECT_ROOT/AGENTS.md"
```

Output: `.agents/knowledge/reference/agents-audit.md`

Score the existing file on:

| Dimension | What to check |
|-----------|--------------|
| Structure | Presence of 10 standard sections (IDENTITY through SELF-EVOLUTION RULES) |
| Signal density | Line count, section count, directive count, file references |
| Risk | Potential secrets, absolute paths, internal URLs |
| Governance | Capture protocol, confidence tracking, SSOT references |

Rating: `good` (8+ sections, 150-300 lines) / `noisy` (>300 lines or <5 sections with bulk content) / `incomplete` (<5 sections) / `risky` (secrets or destructive commands detected)

Report findings to user before proceeding.

### Phase 2: Inventory All Knowledge Artifacts

Output: `.agents/knowledge/reference/artifact-inventory.md`

Scan for every existing knowledge source in the project:

- `AGENTS.md` (root and nested)
- `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/commands/*.md`, `.claude/rules/*.md`
- `.cursor/rules/`, `.cursorrules`
- `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/` directory contents
- `ADR` or `decisions/` directories
- Existing `.agents/` from prior init-deep or other tools
- CI/CD workflows, Dockerfile, Makefile, release scripts

For each artifact: record path, line count, and a 1-line summary of what it contains.

### Phase 3: Extract Implicit Project Knowledge

Output: domain files, inbox entries, `.agents/knowledge/reference/deep-scan-report.md`

Use three-tier extraction depth:

**Tier 1 — Full-repo cheap index** (always):
- Directory tree with file counts
- scan-project.sh output (already run in Mode 2)
- grep -r for `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `XXX`, `DEPRECATED`, `DO NOT`, `NEVER`, `ALWAYS` (bounded to 200 matches)

**Tier 2 — Targeted high-signal reads** (scaled by project size):

| Project size | Deep-read budget |
|---|---|
| Small (<100 files) | 25-40 files |
| Medium (100-500 files) | 50-80 files |
| Large (500-2000 files) | 80-140 files |

Priority order for what to read:
1. Entry points (main.*, app.*, index.*)
2. Routing/API definitions
3. Config/schema files
4. CI/build/deploy files
5. Top churn files from `git log --since="6 months ago" --name-only --format="" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20`
6. Files with many convention markers (from Tier 1 grep)
7. Files referenced by existing docs
8. Representative tests (1-2 per test directory)

**Tier 3 — Domain-focused deep dives** (optional, per user request):
- Deep read of a specific subsystem
- Full analysis of a module's conventions and patterns

From readings, generate:
- Domain files for each identified project area
- Inbox entries for observations that don't fit domains
- Intent vs Reality divergences (what docs say vs what code does)
- Convention patterns (naming, error handling, imports)

### Phase 4: Migrate Existing Knowledge

Output: migrated files + `.agents/knowledge/reference/migration-map.md`

For every substantive chunk from Phase 2 artifacts, assign a destination:

| Source content | Destination |
|---|---|
| Project identity, commands, top invariants | Root `AGENTS.md` |
| Module behavior, conventions, pitfalls | `domains/*.md` |
| Large route tables, API inventories, code maps | `reference/*.md` |
| Deployment/release/test workflows | `crystallized/*.md` |
| Architecture decisions with rationale | `decisions/*.md` |
| Tool-specific rules (.cursor, .claude) | `.agents/rules/*.md` |
| Unverified one-off claims | `inbox/{YYYY-MM}.md` |

**Key rule**: nothing valuable is deleted — bulky detail is relocated and linked.

Create a traceability map recording where each piece went:

```markdown
## Migration Map

| Original location | Content summary | Migrated to | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| AGENTS.md lines 45-120 | Database conventions | domains/database.md | observed |
| AGENTS.md lines 200-280 | Deployment runbook | crystallized/deployment-workflow.md | observed |
| .claude/rules/testing.md | Test conventions | domains/testing.md | observed |
| docs/architecture.md | System layers | reference/architecture.md | observed |
```

### Phase 5: Restructure AGENTS.md

Output: `AGENTS.md.proposed` first, then live replacement after approval.

1. Archive the original: move to `.agents/knowledge/archive/AGENTS.before-onboarding.md`
2. Build new AGENTS.md using the standard template (`root-agents-existing.md`)
3. Fill from domain files generated in Phases 3-4
4. Keep only high-retrieval content in root (IDENTITY, COMMANDS, WHERE TO LOOK, top invariants/anti-patterns, governance sections)
5. Everything else becomes linked knowledge in `domains/`, `reference/`, `crystallized/`

**Approval gate**: Write `AGENTS.md.proposed` and present diff to user. Only replace live AGENTS.md after explicit approval.

### Phase 6: Discover Skills and Report

Output: `manifest.json` `skills.pending_review` + `.agents/knowledge/reference/onboarding-report.md`

1. Use detected technologies (from scan-project.sh) as input for `find-skills`
2. Write candidates to `manifest.json` `skills.pending_review`
3. Identify best-practice gaps — concrete findings, not vague recommendations:
   - "Project uses X but has no documented conventions for it"
   - "Tests exist but no test command in AGENTS.md"
   - "Multiple TODO/HACK markers cluster in module Y"
4. **Run Hook Integration Decision Point** if `manifest.json` `hooks.integration` is missing, set to `deferred`, OR set to a tool but the adapter file no longer exists. See `## Hook Integration Decision Point` section. Mode 2B re-asks because brownfield projects often inherit a half-wired state. Record the result in `manifest.json`.
5. Generate final onboarding report summarizing all phases, including an explicit `Hook integration: <state>` line in the report header — one of "active (opencode adapter wired)", "deferred (re-asks next session)", "declined", or "custom (manual integration)". Do NOT use the bare phrase "3 hooks installed" anywhere in the report; that conflates "scripts on disk" with "hooks active".

### Completion Criteria

- agents-audit.md exists with quality score
- artifact-inventory.md exists with all knowledge sources listed
- Domain files generated from deep extraction (not just surface scan)
- Migration map traces all relocated content
- AGENTS.md restructured (or .proposed ready for approval)
- Onboarding report summarizes findings and next steps, AND explicitly states the Hook integration state ("active / deferred / declined / custom") on a dedicated line — not buried inside an artifact-count phrase
- onboarding-state.json shows all phases completed
- **Hook integration decision recorded**: `manifest.json` `hooks.integration` is one of `opencode | claude-code | cursor | augment-code | custom | declined | deferred`. If a tool was selected, the corresponding adapter file is present and references the hook scripts.

## Mode 3: Capture (Ambient Protocol)

This is NOT a mode the user explicitly triggers. It is a standing instruction that applies during normal work.

### When to Capture

After completing any task that involved one or more of:
1. Discovering how something works that was not obvious from file names alone
2. Fixing a bug that revealed a hidden assumption or invariant
3. Making a decision that constrains future work
4. Noticing a pattern repeated across multiple files or modules
5. Finding that existing knowledge (in .agents/knowledge/ or AGENTS.md) was wrong or stale

### How to Capture

Append to `.agents/knowledge/inbox/{YYYY-MM}.md` (create the monthly file if it doesn't exist):

**Format:**

```
## {date} {time} — {what task you just completed}

- {what you learned / discovered / noticed — in your own words}
- {additional observation if applicable}
- [source: {file:line | config key | test name | commit hash}]
```

The entry should capture **what surprised you** or **what wasn't obvious** — not routine facts. Adapt the depth and detail to match the significance of the finding. One observation with a clear source is better than five vague ones.

**Concrete example** (illustrative only — adapt format and content to your project):

```markdown
## 2026-04-25 14:30 — Fixed cache invalidation race condition

- The write lock in cache/invalidator.py doesn't cover the DB delete, causing
  stale entries when 2+ requests arrive within 100ms
- Cache TTL is 15min (config.py:28), not 1h as stated in domains/caching.md
- [source: src/cache/invalidator.py:142-167]
```

### Capture Rules

- No classification needed. The inbox is append-only.
- **Optional channel markers**: When the entry type is obvious, prefix the heading with `[ERROR]`, `[DECISION]`, or `[INCIDENT]`. This speeds up evolve triage but is never required — routine observations need no marker. The existing `[DOMAIN-FIX]`, `[SKILL-FIX]`, `[SKILL-IDEA]`, and `[SKILL-COMPAT]` tags already serve as channel markers for their respective purposes.
- Keep entries brief: 2-5 bullet points per observation.
- Always include at least one source reference.
- Do NOT attempt to organize, deduplicate, or promote during capture.
- Do NOT update AGENTS.md during capture.

**Metadata Discipline**: Do not add metadata that requires global consistency (sequential IDs, cross-file reference graphs, recurrence counters) unless it is generated by a script. Capture-time entries need only timestamp, observation, and source. Classification, clustering, recurrence detection, and provenance tracking happen during Evolve mode, not during capture.

### Concurrent Session Safety

Multiple sessions may write to the same inbox file. To prevent data loss:

1. **Write to a temporary file first**: Create `inbox/{YYYY-MM}.tmp.{random}` with the new entry
2. **Append atomically**: Read the existing monthly file, append the new entry, write the result. If the file changed during read (contention), re-read and retry once.
3. **Fallback**: If append fails after retry, leave the `.tmp.{random}` file in place — it will be discovered during the next evolution session.
4. **Large file rotation**: If the monthly file exceeds 200 entries, create `{YYYY-MM}-2.md` (then `-3.md`, etc.)

Each entry is self-contained (header + bullets + source), so interleaved writes from concurrent sessions produce valid content even without locking — the temporary file protocol prevents data loss, not corruption.

### When NOT to Capture

- Trivial one-line changes (typo fixes, formatting)
- Information already well-documented in the knowledge base
- Sensitive data (secrets, credentials, personal information)
- Temporary debugging observations (unless they reveal a persistent gotcha)

**Security default**: All knowledge is treated as internal to the project. Before promoting knowledge to any public-facing document (README, docs site, public API docs), verify it contains no internal operational details, credentials references, infrastructure addresses, or security-sensitive implementation specifics. When in doubt, keep it internal.

### Recording Architecture Decisions

When a significant technical decision is made (framework choice, data model, API architecture, infrastructure), create an ADR in `.agents/knowledge/decisions/` using `references/templates/decision-template.md`. Decisions skip the inbox — they go directly to `decisions/` with `confidence: observed` and the context that drove the choice.

---

## Mode 4: Evolve

Explicit evolution session. The user triggers this. Read `references/lifecycle.md` for detailed mechanics.

### Manifest Recovery

Before starting, verify manifest.json:
- **If missing**: Rebuild from filesystem — scan all `.agents/knowledge/` files, read frontmatter, reconstruct inventory and health metrics. Set `initialized_from` to `"recovered"`.
- **If corrupted** (invalid JSON): Rename to `manifest.json.corrupt`, rebuild from filesystem.
- **If schema version mismatch**: Migrate by adding missing fields with defaults, never dropping existing data.
- **If readable but incomplete** (missing required sections like `health` or `inventory`): Add missing sections with zero/empty defaults, preserve existing data.
- **If unreadable** (permission error): Report the error, do not proceed with evolution until the user fixes permissions.
- **If `.agents/knowledge/` is partially initialized** (some directories missing): Create missing directories, then rebuild manifest from what exists.

### Evolution Checklist

1. **Assess health**: Read manifest.json (recovering first if needed). Run health check (see Mode 5). Report current state.

2. **Process inbox**: Read all inbox files.
   - Identify clusters: 3+ entries on the same theme
   - For each cluster: merge into a domain file (create new or append to existing)
   - Use template `references/templates/topic-template.md` for new domain files
   - **Per-entry processing**: After merging, handle each processed entry:
     - If ALL entries in a monthly file were absorbed: move the entire file to `archive/`
     - If SOME entries were absorbed: leave the monthly file in `inbox/` but add `<!-- absorbed into domains/X.md on {date} -->` comment after each processed entry. The entry text stays (for traceability) but is marked as processed.
     - If an entry was NOT absorbed (doesn't fit any cluster): leave it unmarked in inbox
   - Never delete inbox content — either archive the whole file or mark entries as absorbed

   **Clustering logic**: Group entries by the project area they relate to (same module, same subsystem, same concern). The theme is determined by what the entries are ABOUT, not by keywords. Three entries about database connection pooling from different sessions are a cluster, even if they use different terminology.

   **Recurring theme detection**: After clustering, identify themes that appear 3+ times across different sessions or time periods. These are promotion signals — report them in the evolution summary so the user can decide whether to promote, crystallize, or investigate root cause.

   **Per-entry absorption marking format**:
   ```
   {original entry text stays intact}
   <!-- absorbed into domains/{domain}.md on {date} -->
   ```

   **Concrete example** (illustrative — adapt to your project's actual themes):

   Inbox has 5 entries: 4 relate to database queries, 1 to deployment.
   → Merge 4 database entries into `domains/database.md`, mark each with `<!-- absorbed -->`.
   → Leave the deployment entry unmarked (may cluster with future deployment observations).

3. **Verify spot-checks**: Pick 2-3 domain or pattern files.
   - Read the scoped source files
   - Compare claims to current code
   - Update `last_verified` if claims still hold
   - Correct claims that are now wrong
   - Mark files as stale candidates if you cannot verify now

4. **Detect staleness**: Flag files where:
   - `last_verified` is older than the threshold for that type (domains: 60 days, reference: 90 days, patterns: 90 days) AND
   - Source files in the declared scope have been modified since last_verified
   - Add to manifest.json `stale_candidates` list

5. **Resolve conflicts**: When contradictory claims are found across files:
   - Check the actual code/config to determine ground truth
   - If resolvable: update the incorrect entry, note the correction, cite evidence
   - If both sides have valid evidence (e.g., different scopes): document both with explicit scope boundaries
   - If genuinely ambiguous: flag for human arbitration in manifest.json `conflicts` list
   - Never leave a conflict unresolved without documenting it

   **Example — resolving a conflict:**

   `domains/deployment.md` says: "Token expiry is 24h"
   `inbox/2026-04.md` says: "Token expiry changed to 12h"

   **Conflict resolution pattern**: Always check the actual source of truth (code, config, tests) before updating knowledge. If the code disagrees with documentation, the code wins. If two scopes are both valid, document both with explicit boundaries.

   **Concrete example** (illustrative):
   Domain file says "expiry is 24h", inbox says "changed to 12h" → read the actual config → code shows 12h → update the domain file, cite the code, note the change history.

6. **Evaluate promotions**:
   - domains → patterns: Has the knowledge been verified across 2+ contexts? Is it reusable? Promote using `references/templates/pattern-template.md`
   - patterns → AGENTS.md: Is it stable, navigation-critical, and high-retrieval-value? Propose to user before adding.
   - patterns → crystallized: Does it describe a repeatable workflow? See Crystallization section.

   **Promotion criteria**: Knowledge earns promotion by surviving repeated use and verification, not by age. A convention observed in 3 different modules is more promotable than a fact observed once 6 months ago. Promotion is always to the NEXT level (domain → pattern → AGENTS.md), never skipping.

   **Application tracking**: When a pattern is referenced or used to guide a decision during normal work, increment its `application_count` and update `last_applied` in frontmatter. Patterns with high `application_count` + recent `last_applied` are strong promotion candidates. Patterns with `application_count: 0` after 90 days are retirement candidates.

   **Specialization detection** (only if project-local): When a pattern appears project-specific (applies only to this project type, not universally), add it as a candidate to `SKILL-LOCAL.md` Candidate Specializations instead of promoting to AGENTS.md. Mode 7 will review and promote.

   **Concrete example** (illustrative):
   A naming convention (e.g., "all config keys use kebab-case") verified across 3+ files and 2+ sessions → promote from domain to pattern with evidence links.

7. **Update manifest.json**: Regenerate inventory and health metrics from current file state.

8. **Update AGENTS.md "Where to Look" table**: Add/remove entries matching current domain/reference files.

9. **Re-check hook integration**: If `manifest.json` `hooks.integration` is `deferred` OR missing, run the Hook Integration Decision Point now (see `## Hook Integration Decision Point`). Evolve sessions are a natural moment to revisit deferred decisions. If integration is set to a tool but the adapter file is missing or stale, prompt for repair (re-run installer) or for an explicit decline.

10. **Report**: Summarize what changed:
   - Items compressed from inbox
   - New domains created
   - Knowledge corrected or updated
   - Staleness detected
   - Conflicts found and how they were resolved
   - Promotions made
   - **Recurring themes**: list themes that appeared 3+ times with entry count (e.g., "deployment/version mismatch — 4 entries across 3 sessions"). These are crystallization or root-cause-investigation candidates.
   - Hook integration state (active / deferred / declined / custom / broken) and any change since previous session
   - Health score before → after

---

## Mode 5: Health Check

Read `references/health-check.md` for metric definitions and scoring.

### Quick Health Check

A fast triage that reports key indicators WITHOUT computing a full numeric score. The full scoring formula (in health-check.md) requires deeper analysis that belongs in a Deep Health Check.

1. **Verify AGENTS.md integrity** (always first):
   - Does AGENTS.md contain a "POST-TASK CHECKLIST" section?
   - Does it reference `.agents/knowledge/`?
   - Does it have a "SELF-EVOLUTION RULES" section?
   - If any are missing: report as critical — the self-evolution system is disconnected
2. **Verify manifest.json** — if missing or corrupt, rebuild from filesystem before continuing
3. **Verify hook integration state**:
   - Read `manifest.json` `hooks.integration`. If absent OR set to `deferred`, surface as a high-priority action: "Hook integration is unwired — run the Hook Integration Decision Point (see SKILL.md) to choose opencode / claude-code / cursor / augment-code / custom."
   - If set to a tool but the corresponding adapter file is missing or no longer references the hook scripts, surface as critical: "Hook integration recorded as `{tool}` but adapter file is missing or stale — hooks are not actually firing."
   - If set to `declined` or `custom`, no action needed; record in the report.
4. **Report key indicators** (no score calculation needed):
   - Inbox item count and oldest unprocessed date
   - Stale candidate count (from manifest)
   - Conflict count (from manifest)
   - Confidence distribution (count of observed/verified/canonical files)
   - Hook integration state (active / deferred / declined / custom / broken)
5. **Report top 3 priority actions** based on the triage order in health-check.md. Hook integration in `deferred` or `broken` state is always in the top 3.

### Deep Health Check

Computes the full numeric health score using the formula in health-check.md.

1. Run quick health check indicators first
2. Additionally: scan all knowledge files (excluding inbox files, which have no frontmatter) for:
   - Missing frontmatter (type, confidence, scope, sources, last_verified)
   - Missing sources (claims without evidence)
   - Empty "Verified Facts" sections (content only in "Working Understanding")
   - Files with no cross-references (orphaned knowledge)
   - Domain files with scope fields that point to non-existent directories
   - Broken AGENTS.md pointers (Where to Look entries pointing to missing files)
   - Missing .agents/rules/ files for existing domain files
   - Hook adapter staleness: if `hooks.integration` points to a tool, verify the adapter file exists and the plugin / hooks key still references the scripts in `.agents/hooks/` by absolute path
3. Report full health analysis with actionable recommendations

---

## Mode 6: Crystallize

Transform repeated procedural knowledge into an executable workflow document that can later become a skill.

### Crystallization Triggers

Propose crystallization when you notice:
- A workflow performed 3+ times across sessions with consistent steps
- A pattern file with a "Steps" or "Workflow" section that keeps getting refined
- Multiple inbox entries describing the same procedural sequence
- User explicitly asks to formalize a process

### Crystallization Steps

1. Gather all related knowledge: inbox entries, domain sections, pattern files, session experience
2. Extract the workflow into `references/templates/crystallized-template.md` format
3. Write to `.agents/knowledge/crystallized/{workflow-name}.md`
4. Set: `refinement_count: 1`, `skill_candidate: false`
5. Link back to source knowledge in `sources` field
6. Report to user: what was crystallized, from what sources, what needs refinement

### Refinement

Each time a crystallized workflow is used:
1. Compare actual execution against documented steps
2. Note deviations: missing steps, unnecessary steps, wrong decision criteria
3. Update the workflow file, increment `refinement_count`, add to Refinement Log
4. After 3+ refinements: evaluate the Skill Readiness Assessment checklist

### Skill Graduation

When `skill_candidate: true` AND all readiness checklist items pass:
1. Suggest to user: "The workflow '{name}' has been refined {N} times and appears ready to become a reusable skill. Create it?"
2. If approved, ensure `skill-creator` is available:
   ```bash
   # If skill-creator is not in your available skills, install it:
   npx skills add https://github.com/anthropics/skills --skill skill-creator -g -y
   ```
3. Use `skill-creator` skill to transform the crystallized doc into a proper skill
   - Feed the crystallized doc as primary input context
   - The doc's Problem → skill description
   - The doc's Workflow → skill instructions
   - The doc's Refinement Log entries → skill test cases
   - The doc's Edge Cases → skill guardrails
4. Created skill goes to `.agents/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`
5. Update crystallized doc: set `skill_path`, note graduation date

### Skill Discovery

Before building a capability from scratch, check if a skill already exists. Ensure the discovery skill is available:

```bash
# If find-skills is not in your available skills, install it:
npx skills add https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills --skill find-skills -g -y

# Search for skills
npx skills find [query]

# Install a skill
npx skills add <owner/repo> --skill <skill-name> -g -y
```

Once `find-skills` is installed, the AI can discover skills conversationally — ask "is there a skill for X?" and it will search and offer installation.

Browse available skills at: https://skills.sh/

## Skill Feedback Capture

When use of this skill reveals a flaw in the skill itself — a missing step, a confusing instruction, a broken assumption, or a better approach seen elsewhere — record it as a lightweight project-local inbox entry. Do NOT modify the skill during normal work.

### Tags

| Tag | When to use | Example |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `[SKILL-FIX:self-evolution]` | Concrete failure in current behavior | "Capture declaration was not executed" |
| `[SKILL-IDEA:self-evolution]` | Possible capability expansion | "Could detect unused domain files automatically" |
| `[SKILL-COMPAT:self-evolution/<other-skill>]` | Technique observed in another skill | "learn-eval skill has quality gates on pattern extraction" |

### Format

Same as regular inbox capture — append to `.agents/knowledge/inbox/{YYYY-MM}.md`:

```
## {date} {time} — self-evolution skill feedback
- [SKILL-FIX:self-evolution] Agent declared `Capture: inbox` but did not actually write the entry.
- Impact: false completion signal; user had to catch it manually.
- Suggested repair: require write-before-declare in capture protocol.
```

### Rules

- **Zero overhead on normal work** — same 3-line cost as regular capture
- **Do not modify the installed skill** during project work — side effects cross projects
- **Stability fixes (`[SKILL-FIX]`) outrank capability ideas (`[SKILL-IDEA]`)** — always
- **`[SKILL-IDEA]` needs 2+ independent observations** before promotion — prevents wishlist landfill

---

## Mode 7: Skill Maintenance

Explicit maintenance session for the skill itself. Triggered only by user request ("improve the skill", "skill maintenance") or when evolve mode detects 3+ tagged skill feedback entries and asks the user.

### Process

1. **Collect** all `[SKILL-FIX]`, `[SKILL-IDEA]`, and `[SKILL-COMPAT]` entries from inbox
2. **Deduplicate** by root cause — multiple symptoms may point to one flaw
3. **Classify** each as:
   - `repair` — clear fix, bounded scope, apply now
   - `backlog` — valid but needs more evidence or design work
   - `reject` — not worth the complexity, with documented reason
   - `needs-evidence` — plausible but unverified, leave in inbox
4. **Apply repairs** — modify SKILL.md, templates, scripts, or hooks. Each change must cite the captured issue.
5. **Capability Radar** (only if `[SKILL-IDEA]` or `[SKILL-COMPAT]` items exist):

   ```
   Budget:
   - Max 3 external skill searches (npx skills find)
   - Max 5 candidate techniques evaluated
   - Max 30 minutes total
   - Each candidate: adopt / defer / reject with 1-line reason
   - No adoption unless tied to a captured failure, eval gap, or explicit user goal
   ```

   **Skill-focused search**: Use `find-skills` to search for skills that address captured `[SKILL-IDEA]` or `[SKILL-COMPAT]` items. Write candidates to `manifest.json` `skills.pending_review` immediately — do not stop to ask the user mid-search. Present the full pending list at the end of maintenance for batch confirmation. Confirmed installs move to `skills.installed`.

6. **Specialization review** (only if project-local, i.e., `SKILL-LOCAL.md` exists):
   - Check `SKILL-LOCAL.md` Candidate Specializations for items ready to promote
   - For each candidate with sufficient evidence: promote to Active Overrides
   - For candidates without evidence after 90 days: remove
   - Check if any active override has become generic (applies to unrelated projects) → suggest merge to global skill
7. **Update EVOLUTION-SPEC.md** — promoted items go to Improvement Backlog or become dimension updates. Rejected items noted with reason.
8. **Version the change** — update Review Log in EVOLUTION-SPEC.md
9. **Report** — what was fixed, what was deferred, what was rejected, what capability candidates were found, what specializations were promoted or retired

### Guardrails

- **No self-edits during normal work** — maintenance is a dedicated mode
- **No unreviewed promotion** — observation → triage → explicit approval → change
- **Every change maps to a captured issue** — no speculative improvements
- **Stability fixes before capability expansion** — always
- **Rollback path** — commit/snapshot before maintenance changes

---

## Project-Local Specialization

This skill can gradually specialize for a project type — like fine-tuning a base model with domain-specific data.

### How It Works

`SKILL-LOCAL.md` is NOT a separate skill — it is a configuration file that the global self-evolution skill reads when it exists in the project. This avoids same-name skill conflicts entirely.

```
Global skill triggered by user
  → reads own SKILL.md (base behavior)
  → checks: does .agents/knowledge/SKILL-LOCAL.md exist in this project?
  → if yes: reads it as higher-priority overlay
  → if no: runs with default behavior only
```

The file lives at `.agents/knowledge/SKILL-LOCAL.md` (inside the knowledge directory, not as a separate skill). It is project-specific content, versioned with the project, and managed alongside other knowledge files.

### Detection

Check for `.agents/knowledge/SKILL-LOCAL.md` in the project root. If found, read it after SKILL.md and apply its overrides. If not found, no specialization — use defaults.

### Specialization Lifecycle

```
Project work produces inbox observations
  → Mode 4 (Evolve) detects project-specific patterns
  → Pattern repeats 3+ times across sessions
  → Mode 4 writes candidate to SKILL-LOCAL.md "Candidate Specializations"
  → Mode 7 (Skill Maintenance) reviews candidates
  → Promoted candidates become "Active Overrides" in SKILL-LOCAL.md
  → Active overrides modify skill behavior for this project only
```

### What Can Be Specialized

| Aspect | Override mechanism |
|--------|-------------------|
| Additional capture conditions | `SKILL-LOCAL.md` → Active Overrides → Capture Conditions |
| Staleness thresholds per domain | `SKILL-LOCAL.md` → Active Overrides → Health Threshold Overrides |
| Promotion criteria | `SKILL-LOCAL.md` → Active Overrides → Promotion Criteria Overrides |
| Domain template sections | `SKILL-LOCAL.md` → Active Overrides (additional sections for specific domain types) |

### What Cannot Be Specialized

- Core lifecycle stages (capture → compress → verify → promote → crystallize → retire)
- Confidence model (observed → verified → canonical)
- AGENTS.md governance structure
- Anti-overconfidence rules
- Filesystem contract

These are architectural invariants — changing them creates a fork, not a specialization.

### Drift Prevention

- **SKILL-LOCAL.md is a knowledge file, not a skill file** — it lives in `.agents/knowledge/`, not `.agents/skills/`
- **Separate candidates from active rules** — candidates do not affect behavior until promoted in Mode 7
- **Require evidence for promotion** — repeated across 2+ tasks, tied to an incident, or explicitly requested by user
- **Review metadata on each rule** — `added`, `reason`, `confidence`
- **Merge back when generic** — if a rule applies across unrelated projects, it belongs in the global skill

### Template

Use `references/templates/skill-local-template.md` to create a new SKILL-LOCAL.md.

## Anti-Overconfidence Rules

These rules apply to ALL modes. They are the system's most important safety mechanism.

### The Confidence Ladder

| Level | Meaning | Where it lives | How it's earned |
|-------|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| `observed` | Seen once, single source | inbox/, early domains/ | Default for ALL AI-generated content |
| `verified` | Corroborated by 2+ sources or checked against code | domains/, patterns/ | Evidence from multiple files, tests, or sessions |
| `canonical` | Source of truth, stable convention | AGENTS.md | Human approval or repeated verification over time |

### Hard Rules

1. **All AI-generated knowledge starts as `observed`.** No exceptions — except pre-filled governance sections (SESSION START, CODING DISCIPLINE, POST-TASK CHECKLIST, SELF-EVOLUTION RULES) in init templates, which are canonical from day one because they define the system itself, not project facts.
2. **Every non-trivial claim needs a source.** Either inline `[source: file:line]` or in frontmatter `sources:` field.
3. **Never summarize code you have not read.** Do not infer architecture from directory names. Do not guess module relationships from file names.
4. **"Unknown" is a valid and valuable answer.** Every domain file should have an "Open Questions" section. Leaving it empty when you have genuine uncertainty is a failure.
5. **Promotion requires evidence, not confidence.** To move from observed → verified, cite 2+ corroborating sources. To move to canonical, get human approval.
6. **Never silently resolve conflicts.** When two knowledge entries contradict, check actual code. If still ambiguous, surface both and flag for human review.
7. **Scope your claims.** "This module uses X" is better than "This project uses X" — unless you have verified project-wide.
8. **Separate fact from interpretation.** Use "Verified Facts" for things directly confirmed by code. Use "Working Understanding" for interpretive conclusions.

### Forbidden Patterns

- Writing "the project follows X pattern" based on seeing it in 1 file
- Omitting "Open Questions" because you feel confident
- Setting confidence to "verified" without citing multiple sources
- Updating AGENTS.md conventions without evidence from patterns/
- Compressing inbox items and discarding unique details that didn't fit the summary
- Presenting init output as authoritative project documentation

---

## Root AGENTS.md Governance

The root AGENTS.md is the most-read file in the system. Protect its stability and signal density.

### What Belongs in AGENTS.md

- Project identity: name, purpose, tech stack, goals, architecture overview
- Structure map: key directories and their roles
- Key commands: build, test, run, deploy
- Coding discipline: behavioral rules that every session needs
- Stable conventions: 5-15 rules (as summaries pointing to domain files)
- Anti-patterns: 3-10 critical things to never do (pointing to domain files)
- "Where to Look" table: task → file mapping (including .agents/knowledge/ paths)
- Session start protocol
- Post-task checklist with capture triggers
- Self-evolution rules with SSOT enforcement

### What Does NOT Belong in AGENTS.md

- Detailed module documentation (goes in domains/)
- Full convention text (domain files hold the authoritative detail)
- Decision records (goes in decisions/)
- Evolving patterns (goes in patterns/ until stable)
- Observations and working theories (goes in inbox/ or domains/)

### When to Update AGENTS.md

- A new domain file is created → add to "Where to Look" table
- A pattern is promoted to canonical → add to Conventions as a one-line summary with pointer
- Project structure changes significantly → update Structure map
- Build/test commands change → update Key Commands
- Bootstrap content is verified → remove `<!-- bootstrap -->` marker

## Scope-Triggered Rules Generation

Generate `.agents/rules/` files that push knowledge discovery when the AI works in specific directories.

### How Rules Are Generated

For each domain file created under `.agents/knowledge/domains/`, generate a corresponding rule file under `.agents/rules/`. The rule file is derived from the domain file, not hardcoded.

**Rule naming**: `{domain-name}-knowledge.md` (matching the domain file name)

**Always generate additionally**: `knowledge-protocol.md` (global capture reminder for all files)

### Scope-to-Glob Conversion

Domain files have a `scope` field listing directories and files. Convert these to glob patterns for rule files:

| Scope value | Glob pattern | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------| 
| Directory path ending in `/` | `{path}**` | `src/payments/` → `src/payments/**` |
| Specific file | Exact path | `src/config.py` → `src/config.py` |
| Wildcard in path | Keep as-is | `src/middleware/pay*` → `src/middleware/pay*` |

**Concrete example** (illustrative — adapt domain name, scope, and invariants to your project):

Domain file frontmatter: `scope: ["src/payments/", "src/middleware/pay*"]`

Generated rule file `.agents/rules/payments-knowledge.md`:
```markdown
---
description: "Read payments knowledge before modifying files in this scope"
globs:
  - "src/payments/**"
  - "src/middleware/pay*"
---
Before making changes in this area, read `.agents/knowledge/domains/payments.md`.

Key invariants:
- All monetary amounts stored as integers (cents) to avoid floating-point drift
- Refund requests validate against original transaction before processing

After completing work, capture observations to `.agents/knowledge/inbox/{YYYY-MM}.md`.
```

### Rule File Format

```markdown
---
description: "Read {domain} knowledge before modifying files in this scope"
globs:
  - "{glob patterns matching the domain file's scope field}"
---
Before making changes in this area, read `.agents/knowledge/domains/{domain}.md` for conventions, invariants, and known pitfalls.

Key invariants for this area:
- {top 3-4 invariants extracted from the domain file's Core Invariants section}

After completing work, capture observations to `.agents/knowledge/inbox/{YYYY-MM}.md`.
```

**The `knowledge-protocol.md` (global rule):**

```markdown
---
description: "Project knowledge capture protocol"
globs:
  - "**/*"
---
After completing any non-trivial task, check if any of these capture conditions apply:
1. Discovered how something works
2. Fixed a bug revealing a hidden assumption
3. Made a constraining decision
4. Noticed a cross-file pattern
5. Found existing knowledge was wrong

If yes, append to .agents/knowledge/inbox/{YYYY-MM}.md
```

### Tool Compatibility

The `.agents/rules/` directory is the canonical location. If the project also uses tool-specific rule directories (`.claude/rules/`, `.cursor/rules/`, etc.), create copies or symlinks there using the tool's native frontmatter format. Only create tool-specific copies if the corresponding directory already exists in the project.

---

## Hook Integration Decision Point

**This is not optional in the sense of "skip silently." Every Mode 1 / Mode 2 / Mode 2B run MUST surface this decision to the user — either by performing it during the run, or by recording an explicit declination. "Hook scripts on disk" and "hooks active" are different states; they must not be conflated.**

### Why a decision point is needed

The scaffold script (`init-scaffold.sh`) creates three POSIX shell scripts under `.agents/hooks/` (`session-end.sh`, `stop.sh`, `compact-recovery.sh`). These scripts are **inert until a tool adapter is wired**. An adapter is a tool-specific config file (e.g. `.opencode/opencode.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.cursor/hooks.json`, `.augment/settings.json`) that subscribes the tool's lifecycle events to the shell scripts.

Without the adapter:

- `session-end.sh` never fires when a session ends → no inbox capture marker → POST-TASK CHECKLIST relies entirely on model recall
- `stop.sh` never fires when a task completes → no deterministic reminder when `inbox_count > 10` or `days_since_evolution > 14`
- `compact-recovery.sh` never fires after context compaction → the model can drift away from AGENTS.md invariants without warning

These are the failure modes the hook system was designed to prevent. Leaving the scripts unwired silently re-creates them.

### What the agent MUST do

After the scaffold step in any init mode, present this decision to the user with all four options enumerated:

```
Hook scripts are now on disk at .agents/hooks/. They will only fire if wired to your tool's
lifecycle events. Pick one:

  1. opencode      — copies your global ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json to
                     .opencode/opencode.json (preserving providers / plugins / MCP servers)
                     and registers .agents/hooks/opencode-plugin.mjs as a plugin. The native
                     plugin maps session.idle → stop.sh, session.deleted → session-end.sh,
                     experimental.session.compacting → compact-recovery.sh. Full coverage of
                     all 3 lifecycle events. Global config is untouched.

  2. claude-code   — merges a "hooks" key into .claude/settings.json that wires
                     SessionEnd → session-end.sh and Stop → stop.sh. compact-recovery.sh
                     is supported via SessionStart with the "compact" matcher. If
                     .claude/settings.json already has a hooks key, the installer warns
                     and leaves it untouched (manual merge required).

  3. cursor        — copies a hooks.json adapter into .cursor/hooks.json. Same script
                     wiring as Claude Code. If the file already exists and differs, the
                     installer warns and skips.

  4. augment-code  — merges a hooks key into .augment/settings.json. Same wiring shape
                     as Claude Code.

  5. custom        — leave hooks unwired; you will integrate them manually into another
                     tool, OR you decline hooks for this project. The agent records the
                     decision in .agents/knowledge/manifest.json under
                     `hooks.integration: "declined" | "custom"` so a future evolve session
                     does not re-prompt.

Pick a number, or say "skip" to decide later (the prompt will re-appear next time you run
init, evolve, or health check).
```

After the user chooses:

- **Options 1-4**: run `sh "references/hooks/install-hooks.sh" --project-root "$PROJECT_ROOT" --tool {choice}`. The installer is idempotent — running it again is safe. After the install, **verify** by listing `.{tool}/...` adapter file presence and confirming the plugin reference is in place. If install fails, surface the error and offer the next option, do not fall through silently.
- **Option 5 (custom)**: write to `manifest.json`:
  ```json
  "hooks": {
    "integration": "custom",
    "decided_at": "{ISO date}",
    "note": "{user-supplied or 'manual integration; not using a bundled adapter'}"
  }
  ```
  Or for explicit decline:
  ```json
  "hooks": {
    "integration": "declined",
    "decided_at": "{ISO date}",
    "note": "{reason}"
  }
  ```
- **"Skip"**: write `"hooks": { "integration": "deferred", "asked_at": "{ISO date}" }` to manifest. The next init/evolve/health-check session re-asks.

### What "wired" actually verifies

Hooks are verifiably wired when ALL of:

1. The 3 hook scripts exist in `.agents/hooks/` and are executable (chmod +x).
2. A tool-specific adapter file exists with a hook registration:
   - opencode: `.opencode/opencode.json` `plugin` array contains `file://{absolute project root}/.agents/hooks/opencode-plugin.mjs`, AND `.agents/hooks/opencode-plugin.mjs` is present
   - claude-code: `.claude/settings.json` has a top-level `hooks` key with `SessionEnd` / `Stop` entries pointing at the shell scripts
   - cursor: `.cursor/hooks.json` exists with `SessionEnd` / `Stop` entries
   - augment-code: `.augment/settings.json` has the equivalent `hooks` block
3. Manifest `hooks.integration` is set to one of `opencode | claude-code | cursor | augment-code | custom | declined | deferred` so the decision is recorded.

If 1 + 2 + 3 are all satisfied, hooks are wired. Anything less is "scripts on disk only" and must be reported as such.

### Reporting in onboarding output

Whether hooks are wired changes how every Mode reports completion. Reports MUST distinguish:

- ✅ "Hooks active: opencode adapter wired, all 3 events bound"
- ⚠️ "Hooks installed but not wired: 3 scripts on disk, no adapter detected. Decision: deferred — re-asks next session."
- ❌ "Hooks declined: scripts present but adapter not requested. Manifest records `integration: declined`."

Do NOT use the phrase "3 hooks installed" alone — it conflates the two states.

### Hook Design Principles

These properties are stable across all integration choices:

- **Always exit 0** — hooks must never block tool operations
- **Tool-agnostic scripts** — `session-end.sh`, `stop.sh`, and `compact-recovery.sh` are POSIX sh with no tool-specific code
- **Adapter pattern** — Claude Code/Cursor/Augment use JSON configs; OpenCode uses a native ESM plugin that delegates to the same shell scripts
- **Project-scoped** — hooks and adapter configs are installed per-project, never globally
- **Forward-compatible** — AGENTS.md spec proposal #167 is standardizing lifecycle commands; this design aligns with the proposed `post-chat` event

### What each hook does (reference)

| Hook | Event | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| `session-end.sh` | Session terminates | Appends a capture reminder to `inbox/{YYYY-MM}.md` |
| `stop.sh` | Agent completes task | Checks `manifest.json` for inbox pressure / evolution staleness, prints reminder to stderr |
| `compact-recovery.sh` | Context compacted | Outputs re-read directive injected into agent context |

### Adapter quick reference

| Tool | Config Location | Integration |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/settings.json` | JSON adapter merged into settings |
| Cursor | `.cursor/hooks.json` | JSON adapter copied |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/opencode.json` | Native ESM plugin + project-level config (global config copied first to preserve providers/plugins) |
| Augment Code | `.augment/settings.json` | JSON adapter merged into settings |

**OpenCode note**: The installer copies the global `opencode.json` to the project before adding the plugin, because project-level config overrides global config entirely. Without this step, existing provider and plugin configurations would be lost.
